          Moving a entire city
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Northern City of Kiruna in Sweden is going through a long process of being moved from one location to another. This has become necessitated by more than 100 year old practice of mining for iron ore, so that now, cracks are starting to appear in the ground surface, closer and closer to the city centre. Sapsama has helped the two major clients in this endeavour, the Swedish mining giant LKAB and the Municipality. Services have included feasibility studies, design, procurement, construction supervision and contracting as well as project monitoring and evaluation.
